TODO * At least 2 API's. But this can turn into multiple/related projects. 
1. Destination API
2. Order Picking API

TODO * Admin API
- Create an API for the administration. Only there, users (workers) can be added and their rights edited.
- ex: 
GetAllUsers() - should not be in the workers Api.
AddUser() - should be in the AdminApi
ViewPaletteInfo() - should be in AdminApi
